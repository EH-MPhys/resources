# MSP430 Resources

## Introduction
The MSP430 is a low power micro-processor (MCU) from Texas Instruments (TI) designed for mixed signal processing within embedded systems.  There are a whole host of online resoures available to help with development of projects based aorund this MCU, including datasheets, users' guides, example code and example projects both from TI and other online repositories.  The MSP430 comes in a range of variants with sligtly different hardware configurations, capabilities and power consumptions.  In particular there are a range od development boards which are designed specifically to aid in the initial development and testing of systems based around the MSP430.  The TI Launchpads are widely used and are used within this project due to their relativley gently learnign curve (at least in comparison to starting from scratch with single processor).

## TI Resources
One of the best places to start is the TI resources wiki.  This brings together datasheets, users guides and software examples for the range of MSP430's present within the different Launchpads.
