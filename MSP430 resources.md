# MSP430 Resources

## Introduction
The MSP430 is a low power micro-processor (MCU) from Texas Instruments (TI) designed for mixed signal processing within embedded systems.  There are a whole host of online resoures available to help with development of projects based aorund this MCU, including datasheets, users' guides, example code and example projects both from TI and other online repositories.  The MSP430 comes in a range of variants with sligtly different hardware configurations, capabilities and power consumptions.  In particular there are a range od development boards which are designed specifically to aid in the initial development and testing of systems based around the MSP430.  The TI Launchpads are widely used and are used within this project due to their relativley gently learnign curve (at least in comparison to starting from scratch with single processor).


## Writing Code
There are various different IDE's that may be used for developing code for the MSP430.  The most versatile and useful is the exlipse-based Code Composer Studio (CCS) from TI themselves.  Free restricted versions are avaiable to download from the TI website.  An alternative to this is CCS Cloud which operates through a browser but which (I expect) fulfils the same functions and fairly similar (though of course requires a functioning network connections to operate).  A thrid option is the Arduino-like Energia.  This has been specifically, like the Arduino IDE, for ease of use and is thus more restrictive than CCS though it may be useful for initial development.  Lastly, IAR workbench can be used as an alternative to CCS and has largely the same functionality and free code-restricted versions. 

## TI Resources
One of the best places to start is the TI cloud tools page.  This brings together datasheets, users guides and software examples for the range of MSP430's present within the different Launchpads.

## Links
- [TI Launchapd homepage](http://www.ti.com/lsds/ti/tools-software/launchpads/launchpads.page)
- [TI Cloud Tools](https://dev.ti.com/) This contains just about all the information that is needed to make simple, and not so simple programs and run them on an MSP430.  In particular the Resource Explorere is an excellent font of knowledged containing links to data sheets, users' guides and example code for a range of different devices.  The CCS Cloud and the GUI Composer are also a look as these may simplify some of the development (a free TI account required for these).
- [Getting started](http://www.ti.com/lsds/ti/microcontrollers_16-bit_32-bit/msp/getting-started.page#) with the MSP430.  this is a very handy little guide to why you may want you use the MSP430 (according to TI...) and advice on device selection and getting started. This is higher level stuff rather than how to actually programme a device and is very useful to consider before actually designing/coding.
